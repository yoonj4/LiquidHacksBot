Combat Formula

	Compute Smash Level
	Smash Level (SL) = PlayerLevel + (Stamina% * FighterProficiency% * OpponentKnowledge * FighterMatchup)
	
	Compute Win Odds
	Victory% = 50 + delta_SL
	
	SL 50 vs SL 25
	Odds = 75/25
	SL 4 vs SL 2
	52/48
	SL 90 vs SL 50
	90/10
	SL 99 vs SL 90
	59/41	
	
	Stamina%
		100% = 1
		0% = .5
		Linear from x0.5 to x1.0
		Stamina% = .5 + .5(Stamina / 100)
		
	FighterProficiency%
		Increased by using fighter in Training or Match
		Also has match up history
		lv 1 - 99
		@ lv 1 = x1.0
		@ lv 99 = x1.5
		FighterProficiency% = 1 + .5(fighterProficiency / 100)
		
		Training gives a range of 100 to 5000 EXP, EXP reward scales with Player Level
		Match gives range of 5000 - 10000 EXP, more exp when faced with similar opponent Smash Level
		
		FighterProficiency LV 99 EXP = 1,000,000
		PlayerLevel LV99 EXP = 5,000,000
		
	OpponentKnowledge
		How well do you know the opponent fighter's strengths and weaknesses?
		
		Int matchupCount;
		If matchupCount < 5, then x0.90 multiplier to SL
		if 6 < matchupCount < 20, then x1.00
		if matchupCount > 21, then x1.05
	
	FighterMatchup
		Modifier based on fighter matchup meta
		Create table for each character using data from two methods:
			1. reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/p7a25f/ultimate_matchup_chart_compilation_v6/
			2. Historical win rates via Liquipedia DB
		If no data available, provide negative matchup against all characters since no data means this is a piss low tier fighter and thats why its crap
		
		Using Liquipedia DB, find win rate and apply directly into Smash Level formula
		Example: if pikachu vs DK is 54 / 46, Pikachu player Smash level * .54, DK player Smash Level * .46
